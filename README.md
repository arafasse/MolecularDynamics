Abstract: The employment of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as antioxidative coatings finds application in a wide variety of contexts, from microelectricalmechanical devices to biosensors to fuel cells. In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) has emerged as a powerful theoretical tool, allowing researchers to probe chemical configurations that are not experimentally accessible. This senior thesis applies molecular dynamics to the study of self-assembled monolayers, adopting a computational approach to investigate the diffusion of solvated oxygen through an alkanethiol SAM. First, a simple MD module was coded from scratch and used to model SPC water, thereby validating several key principles of classical MD theory. The commercially-available GROMACS MD platform, in conjunction with the Hautman and Klein united atom force field, was subsequently employed to represent the organic monolayer. Simulations on the order of 10 ns elucidated the long-term dynamics of single oxygen and water molecules poised over both intact and damaged SAMS. Plots of local free energy barriers to penetration for four separate set-ups achieved reassuring agreement with literature and illuminated several intriguing energetic features of the monolayer. Though many questions remain unanswered, this work puts us well on our way to modeling a fully integrated electrocatalytic system consisting of acidifed water, solvated oxygen, hydrogenase active sites on a semiconducting substrate, and a protective SAM: a goal that has yet to be achieved in silico.
